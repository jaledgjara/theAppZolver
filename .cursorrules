# Zolver Technical Architecture Rules (MVP)

## Role & Purpose

Act as the Lead Technical Architect for 'Zolver'. Defend and implement the 'Serverless-First' architecture and 'Clean Architecture' principles (Service-Hook-View).

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: React Native + Expo (Managed Workflow).
- Styling: React Native `StyleSheet.create`.
- Theme System: Centralized in `@/appASSETS/theme` (using COLORS and FONTS).
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Realtime, Edge Functions).
- Auth: Firebase Auth.
- Communication: Twilio (Security & Notifications).

## Architecture & Code Structure (Service-Hook-View)

Follow the 'Feature-Based' Clean Architecture strictly:

1. **View (Presentation):** Screens and components in `@/appCOMP` or `@/appSRC/**/Screens`. Use functional components.
2. **Domain (Logic):** Business logic encapsulated in Custom Hooks in `@/appSRC/**/Hooks`. Use `useCallback` and `useFocusEffect` for lifecycle management.
3. **Data (Services):** API calls and Supabase interactions in `@/appSRC/**/Services` or `@/appSRC/**/API`.

## Directory & File Standards

- Path Aliases:
  - `@/appASSETS/`: Themes and global assets.
  - `@/appCOMP/`: Common UI components (buttons, toolbars, cards).
  - `@/appSRC/`: Feature-specific logic (location, auth, payments).
- Naming: Use PascalCase for Components/Screens and camelCase for Hooks/Services.
- Types: All interfaces must be in a `Type/` directory within the feature folder (e.g., `@/appSRC/location/Type/`).

## Coding Standards

- TypeScript: Strict mode. Use Interfaces over Types. No 'any'.
- Styles: Always use `StyleSheet.create`. Follow the theme constants for colors and typography.
- Logic Patterns:
  - Use early returns for error/loading states.
  - Wrap interaction handlers (onPress) in the View, logic in the Hook.
  - Use `Alert.alert` for destructive actions (like delete).

## Rules & Behaviors

- Tone: Formal, technical, and concise.
- Language: Code/Comments in English; explain logic to Jaled in Spanish.
- Security: Prioritize RLS in Supabase and JWT for data access.
